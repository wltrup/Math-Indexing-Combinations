# Indexing Combinations

How can we compute an index for a given combination of the *n* integers {1,2,3,...,n} taken *k* at a time? Also, given such an index, how can we recover the particular combination that has that index?

It turns out that there is a relatively easy-to-compute expression for the index of such a combination and there's a pretty efficient procedure to recover it, given its index.
